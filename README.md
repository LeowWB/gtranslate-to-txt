Should be called `gtranslate-to-csv` since the output is actually in `.csv` format.

Input is a `.csv` file from Google Translate's saved translations. It'll organize it into an output `.csv` file that you can feed to Anki. Pinyins are not included; you have to enter them yourself if you need them. 

Might wanna change your terminal font too. SimHei works for me.
